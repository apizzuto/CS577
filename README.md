## Introduction to Algorithms at UW-Madison
Instructor: Jiazhen Zhou, Summer 2018

Assignments from an algorithms class covering topics such as divide-and-conquer, dynamic programming, network flow, and NP-completeness. 
All assignments are given as pdfs and in .tex files, and the original assignments are included. If a problem refers to a numbered problem in a book, it is referencing "Algorithm Design" by Kleinberg & Tardos.

Some notes are included, but after the first few days I switched from taking notes in LaTeX to pen and paper, so only the first few days of notes are included
